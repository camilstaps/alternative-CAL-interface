# aCAL: an alternative [CAL][] interface

The [Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon][CAL] is "a text base of the Aramaic texts
in all dialects from the earliest (9<sup>th</sup> Century BCE) through the
13<sup>th</sup> Century CE. [aCAL][] is an alternative interface to the
corresponding lexicon, with the goal of making search more user-friendly,
particularly on mobile devices.

[aCAL][] merely forwards requests to [CAL][] and formats the results in a
different way. All data remains &copy; The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon. If
you use [aCAL][], consider making a contribution to [CAL][].

[aCAL][] is made and maintained by [Camil Staps][].
